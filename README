docbook-xsl-ns
------------------------------------------
DocBook is a schema (available in several languages including RELAX NG, 
SGML and XML DTDs, and W3C XML Schema) maintained by the DocBook 
Technical Committee of OASIS. It is particularly well suited to books

means limited to these applications).
